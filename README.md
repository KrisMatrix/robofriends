# Robofriends Demonstration Project

**License:** MIT License

This is a repository for the Robofriends app made with React. React is a 
open-source frontend framework/library created by Facebook. This is 
project that I created to showcase what I learned with a course on React.

![Robofriends React App](https://github.com/KrisMatrix/robofriends/blob/main/readmeFiles/roboFriends_homepage.png?raw=true)

This project has 6 components:

* src/containers/App.js
* src/components/Card.js
* src/components/CardList.js
* src/components/ErrorBoundary.js
* src/components/Scroll.js
* src/components/SearchBox.js

The App.js is the root component with a header, searchbox, and a container with
cards. The container for all the cards is called Scroll which allows user to
scroll through the robot cards.
